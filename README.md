# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM:
This project involves predicting and forecasting stock market prices using Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal is to utilize historical stock price data to build a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices. The project leverages the capabilities of LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture sequential dependencies in the stock price data.
